*Note: This was an asset store item for Unity3d, but with the days I got busy and stop supporting it, and also sales was not doing great & I decided to not push any features. But many people was reaching me asking for it, and I was throwing a *.unitypackage for them, and with more requests I decided to put the source for free for anyone want to evolve it, use it or learn from it.*
