how to use:

	- Force it to use world space
	- Assign the NGUI camera to it
	- Make sure tha camera can render the UI layer
	- Exclude the UI layer from any other camera
	- Attach it as a child for the root
	- Make sure the scale it 1, and the width and height matches ngui
	- Add the font file to  the fonts root and name it font
	- Start converting

Notes:
	- You can later delete the original nGUI widgets, the tool keeps them for your decision to remove or keep.
	- Any logic or events need to be manually made.
	- It requires NGUI in the project, otherwise you might get errors from some scripts that depends on NGUI existence.
